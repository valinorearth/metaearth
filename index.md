## Metaverse

The Metaverse[^metaverse] is a seamless convergence of our physical and digital lives, creating a unified, virtual community where we can work, play, relax, transact and socialize. The metaverse is still early in its evolution, and there is no singular, all-encompassing definition to which people can turn.

Themes of what the metaverse is and could be, however, are emerging.

A key point is that there is no one virtual world but many worlds, which are taking shape to enable people to deepen and extend social interactions digitally. This is done by adding an immersive, three-dimensional layer to the web, creating more authentic and natural experiences. The metaverse even has the promise of facilitating accessibility from the comfort of the home, breaking down boundaries and democratizing access to key goods, services and experiences.

Before diving deeper into the metaverse, it’s important to lay the foundation between features of today’s metaverse — Web 2.0 characteristics, and the emerging Web 3.0 characteristics. The lines are blurring as more and more traditional virtual worlds are adopting elements of the blockchain-based worlds.


## Why the metaverse and why now?

The concept of a metaverse is not a new one. In many ways this is a linear progression. Online, multi-player, role-playing worlds like The Sims[^thesims] or Second Life[^secondlife] have been around for nearly twenty years, with players spending an average of twenty hours per week in these worlds. Modern equivalents like Minecraft[^Minecraft], World of Warcraft[^worldofwarcraft] and Fortnite[^fortnite] have hundreds of millions of users, and huge supporting economies.

We are now at an inflection point, where it seems that not a day goes by without a company or celebrity announcing that they are building a presence in a virtual universe. While the buzz can partially be attributed to attention- grabbing headlines, there is a convergence of emerging trends.

A number of new technologies have come together to enable this vision of the metaverse. Augmented Reality (AR)[^AR] and virtual reality (VR)[^VR] headsets have become cheaper and more powerful, improving the user experience. Blockchain has enabled digital currencies and NFTs. The new methods to transact and own digital goods are allowing creators to monetize their activities through tokens. In addition to monetization, and as a means to exchange value, token-holders can also participate in the platform’s governance (e.g. vote on decisions). This democratic ownership economy coupled with the possibility of interoperability, could unlock immense economic opportunities, whereby digital goods and services are no longer captive to a singular gaming platform or brand.

From a social perspective, the development of more immersive virtual experiences is helping people to build communities based on shared values, and to express themselves in more authentic ways. Meanwhile, COVID-19 accelerated the digitization of our lives and normalized more persistent and multi-purpose online engagement and communication. It is this combination of technological, social and economic drivers that is resulting in the explosive interest in the metaverse.

## Project “MetaEarth”

> Making sustainability goals easier to achieve for individuals and organizations by providing easy to use carbon sequestering.

### For individuals

Offset emissions as a result of daily activities, such as online shopping or crypto transactions, by contributing to carbon sequestering efforts globally.

### For organizations

Make informed decisions on where you are with you sustainability goals and have more and better options on where to deploy capital and gain granular insight on how they are performing
Contributions will go to traceable and auditable efforts to fund forestation, sustainable agriculture, and other sequestering endeavors. Granular control over type of activity, region, location, and even duration of commitment. 

### Fund afforestation efforts

Maintain trees in endangered forests by funding monitoring operations or purchasing from other entities. Transfer sequestered carbon to other entities from the lands you help forest
Help farmers grow food while making sustainable decisions in their farming operations.

### Partners

- Farmers
- Forestation charities/companies
- Carbon sequestering companies
- Environmental organizations
